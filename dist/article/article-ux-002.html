            </header>
            <section>
                <p>This project took the opportunity to break out of a traditional scrum workflow and utilize user research, a design sprint, new UI concepts, and rapid prototyping to tackle a key user pain point for a quick hackathon.</p>
                <p>The front end architect of the organization came to me with the request for some ideas for hackathon projects, as well as a refreshed UI to show off. I utilized some recent user research and identified searching for contacts as an area to improve. The developers on his team started to research technological solutions to address these, while our team focused on designing solutions to specific functionality problems that had surfaced in user research.</p>
                <p>In the end, we were able to achieve a lot of work in a short period.</p>

                        <li>Short time span (less than a week).</li>
                        <li>Little lead time.</li>
                        <li>Needing to provide developers with solutions as soon as possible with little time for on-the-fly iteration.</li>

                        <li>Create a new style search based around a new search technology.</li>
                        <li>Utilize a design sprint to rapidly iterate as much as possible prior to development.</li>
                        <li>Introduce an updated UI for the project for conceptual purposes.</li>

                <header>
                    <h4>Discovery</h4>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>I organized all of our previous research to identify areas of concern. Searching for contacts within the existing app was identified as a high need as A) it was a high touchpoint for users, and B) it was commonly identified as an area that could
                        use improvements.</p>
                    <p>Much of the research pointed to very highly individualistic feature requests, but a few themes originated, specifically that searches needed to be too specific to net good results.</p>
                    <p>I organized a small group of designers to help in the design sprint (modeled lightly after Google’s design sprint). A design sprint is a good way to rapidly come up with solutions to problems in a minimum viable fashion. Our team had always wanted
                        to try this out, but our normal scrum responsibilities had always presented challenges with its implementation (many teams, few designers, etc.).</p>

                    <h4>Research</h4>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>In a user interview that I conducted, users specifically voiced the need to break out of pre-baked subjects associated with contacts from a dropdown in the search. They were not always aware of the exact phrase needed to find contacts specific to
                        their industry.</p>

                        <div>

                        <figcaption>Some key user observations from a user interview.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The pain points led us to believe that our search needed to be more flexible in general and that the mental model for users was that of industry standards, rather than “advanced searching”. However, our solutions would still need to cater to those
                        who found advanced searching styles useful.</p>
                    <p>We commonly asked users what software they utilized outside of our app, and a common one was Twitter and Google, pointing us toward organic open-ended searching with filtering later. In other words: discovery over specificity.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Our team started with a kickoff to address the problem. We addressed strengths of the current search process, assumptions, threats to solutions, and then identified pitfalls.</p>
                    <p>We focused on some themes to rely on: the new search process must be inviting, entice the users into discovery, and handle different types of data effectively.</p>
                    <p>We then mood boarded some common mental models for searching and contact profiles, as well as landing areas for searches.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Next we used crazy eights to rapidly lo-fi prototype ideas and presented our favorites to one another via Zoom and InVision Freehand while annotating for reactions.</p>

                        <div class="cover">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Afterwards we chose some themes and strengths of the designs presented. This let us choose a winner, but still have some direction for things to adjust or include, showcasing the strengths of each design.</p>

                        <figcaption>A review of strengths and themes from the presented designs.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>After choosing a winner I proceeded to wireframe a clickable wireframe from the presented designs. I focused heavily on the functionality of a search suggestion approach. This would allow our users to type in a generalized phrase and receive (hopefully)
                        instantaneous system feedback on the results for that search phrase.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>After some gorilla testing, and sharing with the hackathon team I iterated on the wireframes to provide a more fleshed out hi-fi prototype. Complete with a new concept for UI.</p>

                    <h4>Results</h4>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>We went from no ideas to completed clickable prototype within two days.</p>
                    <p>The development team went on to code and implement our solution, and present it to the company for their hackathon entry. It was well-received with approval and excitement amongst tech leadership. The concept showed the ability to flexibly search
                        while retaining performance.</p>
                    <p>The user would be able to start broad and filter down later, alleviating anxiety, and raising confidence in the result set.</p>
                    <p>Later this concept would be considered for true implementation.</p>
                    <p>We were not able to user test (unfortunately) as much as we would have preferred, but it would later be implemented if chosen for scrum work.</p>

                    <h4>Learning Opportunities</h4>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>While projects like hackathons can center around direct user needs, there is always the challenge of getting it into production. Including as many people as possible in the process can make people feel part of the solution.</p>
                    <p>Getting to do a design sprint was an incredible learning experience, and it netted a large number of ideas very quickly.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, sprints are challenging, as they force you to think minimally, and thus, there are opportunities that arise that you are unable to expand at that moment. Fortunately, agile strategies allow for work down the road.</p>

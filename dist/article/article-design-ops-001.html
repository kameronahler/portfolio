				<h3>Overview</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>This initiative was an effort to implement user research methodology into a team's process to ensure robust feedback in a fast-paced, agile environment.</p>
				<p>I created the initiative because the team did not have a standard operating procedure, lacked substantial buy-in from the organization, and lacked data that benefit UX teams (behavioral analytics, regular user feedback, data triage, etc.)</p>
				<p>Through this robust effort, I was able to implement solid UX research methods to back up design decisions and support product teams in their efforts.</p>
				<div class="lists">
					<ul>
						<header>
							<h4>Challenges</h4>
						</header>
						<li>Previous research methods were performed ad-hoc.</li>
						<li>The team did not have immediate access to users.</li>
						<li>The data from existing user research was unorganized.</li>
						<li>Insights were not analyzable and hard to target after the research was conducted.</li>
						<li>Documentation for research standard operating procedures was not uniform, or non-existant in some cases.</li>
						<li>Existing behavior analytic tracking lacked depth and was unfit for effective insights.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<header>
							<h4>Goals</h4>
						</header>
						<li>Increase the usage of user research within sprints and general product team methodology.</li>
						<li>Unblock fellow designers from unknowns in the design process.</li>
						<li>Get buy-in from existing product owners.</li>
						<li>Create a research plan that would standardize the methodology.</li>
						<li>Implement a robust tracking app to capture user interactions within the product.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<header>
							<h4>Good to Know</h4>
						</header>
						<li>There was a lot of red tape on this initiative.</li>
						<li>I repeat, there was a lot of red tape.</li>
						<li>Gaining access to users was a difficult battle.</li>
						<li>The initiative was executed over several months.</li>
						<li>Not all of our methodology was approved over the course of several months, requiring us to adjust our goals.</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<header>
							<h4>Role</h4>
						</header>
						<li>I managed the researchers and team involved in executing the initiative, created the vision and execution plan, contributed to various portions, assigned responsibilities, pitched the ideas to executives, and approved all details.</li>
						<li>Several talented team members were involved in this project by executing individual portions of the plan. I primarily helped with user pool recruitment, behavior analytics, standard operating procedure for the team, and identifying potential execution pitfalls in the team.</li>

						<h4>The Previous State of Research</h4>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>I began by identifying where the team had come in terms of user research practices over the years. After seeking input from the team and stakeholders, identifying holes, and researching best practices for execution, I outlined the current state and how to potentially address the issues in a future state.</p>

						<h4>Creating an Action Plan</h4>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>My action plan included the following steps.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Recruit a targeted pool of users that were willing and able to test/interview with us on a rolling basis. This pool would serve many designers, and would be catered to their focuses on various areas of an app.</li>
							<li>Increase the cadence of user testing from an as-needed practice to every sprint for designers that worked within scrum teams.</li>
							<li>Provide the correct users for researchers to explore upcoming product needs outside of regular sprint work.</li>
							<li>Explore <a href="https://pendo.io">Pendo.io</a> to utilize their click-tracking software.</li>
							<li>Create a database that would house user insights in a cross-examinable fashion via tagging.</li>
							<li>Increase awareness of research and buy-in by creating views and open access for Scrum teams into those insights.</li>
							<li>Standardize team research procedures by updating and creating documentation of script and best practices.</li>
							<li>Use the insights to advise product teams on user-centered recommendations, and examining further KPIs over time.</li>

				<h3>Executing</h3>

						<h4>User Research Pool</h4>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>Recruiting for the user pool would require a very pointed targeting effort. To begin, we sought the help of some business analyst teams that would be able to help us massage data coming out of our app's user database. The problem with this data was that nobody had ever used it for this type of effort (lucky us), and we would need to work hand-in-hand with the analyst to make sense of what the fields were.</p>
						<p>After some back and forth, we ended on a result set/data warehouse view that would continually feed us users that had recently logged into the system, and prioritize the users that used the system more regularly.</p>
						<p>After the initial pool was organized, I targeted six segments comprised of users of various areas of the app, which would be associated with a UX designer focusing on that area. This was a challenge because there was overlap amongst users, meaning I had to dissect the database (with others' help), and find the right "recipe" for a certain type of user.</p>
						<p>The goal was to come up with a recruiting list for each segment that would hopefully result in at least one opt-in per five attempts in a recruiting email campaign. By spending time researching the overlap and unique ways to target each segment, we were able to hit that target number.</p>
						<p>Users would be incentivized with prize drawings. The total number of target users for each segment would allow for a new set of 5 users for each designer, every two weeks, without needing to reuse users within a single quarter. Additional designers in the future would require further recruiting. Our recruiting effort culminated in an eamil campaign and sign up via Survey Monkey.</p>

						<h4>Increasing User Research as a Regular Practice</h4>
					</header>
					<section>
						<p>My goal was to create ongoing, regular user research. Just like the US Postal Service - come rain, snow, or sleet. This is a practice that not only uncovers insights on an ongoing basis but also establishes the research as a necessary step in product development. Other companies like Atlassian have adopted practices like this in the past to positive results.</p>
						<figure>

								<img data-src="design-ops-research-plan-increase-research.png" alt="a flowchart for a sprint, including user research as a required step">
							</div>
							<figcaption>A sprint flowchart I made to get buy-in from product teams. Including user research within a sprint would allow scrum teams to always be testing/talking to a user, making their processes less waterfall and more user-centered.</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>Since most of the designers on the team were in scrum sprints, which happen no matter what, why not make testing part of this process? If a designer, for some reason, did not have future designs to research with users, they would use that time to hold a general interview with the user to build empathy instead. This would result in feedback on previously finished Development work, or provide feedback on something being worked on behind the scenes.</p>

							<h4>Introducing Pre-Sprint User Research</h4>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>The team was not used to having dedicated researchers, but with larger and larger asks from Product, we were in a position where it became increasinly important. I instilled two researchers, whose sole responsibilities were to discover issues and explore the connection between user needs and business asks. These individuals would pull from the same user research pool as other in-sprint designers. I would come to think of these designers/researchers as Discovery designers.</p>
							<p>This role was new, and the organization was not used to their focus, so it took some massaging to get the concepts across. My primary goal was to really dig into whether or not initiatives proved useful to users without spending a lot of calories on Development. In most product environments the bottleneck can usually be found close to Development, and rightfully so (building things takes time). However, building the right thing was the most important to our team.</p>
							<figure>
								<div class="">
									<img data-src="design-ops-research-plan-discovery.png" alt="a flowchart showing how a period called Discovery would unfold with user research">
								</div>
								<figcaption>Discovery research was a new, but critical concept. Scrum sprints can sometimes mean shipping solutions regardless of research insights along the way, which can sometimes lead to wasted efforts. User research can help alleviate this problem in some cases, depending on priorities and resources.</figcaption>

							<h4>Utilizing Pendo.io for Behavioral Analytics</h4>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>Pendo was an incredibly powerful tool for the team. It allows you to track all the click events in a site, and who performed that click, even if you don't know you need to track them immediately. The feature set is vast, so I won't cover everything here, but in short, it lets you create segments, potentially message/onboard segments differently, and allows you to get a grasp on where users are interacting with your app in a passive fashion. In short, it's much more quantitative than traditional user research.</p>
							<figure>
								<div class="">
									<img data-src="design-ops-research-plan-pendo.png" alt="screenshot of the pendo app">
								</div>
								<figcaption>Data from an internal environment of Pendo, showing some of the features it can offer, like user and event insights.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>Pendo, however, was not our only choice, and due to budget, I needed to thoroughly vet all options. I started with a basic feature matrix and continued on from there to two winners based on critical features for the team.</p>
							<p>Between the two winners, I scheduled thorough demos, gathered insights from Development to learn about potential pitfalls, and created integration plans, culminating in a thorough audit of both apps' features and benefits in a bakeoff. This was a challenge due to the fact that our chosen winner needed to integrate between more than four apps and user bases, so our requirements were strict and demanding.</p>
							<figure>
								<div class="">
									<img data-src="design-ops-research-plan-heap-vs-pendo.png" alt="spreadsheet data showing a feature comparison between Pendo and Heap, with winners and priority of features">
								</div>
								<figcaption>I explored over 100 different aspects between the two apps, based on team needs, eventually choosing Pendo as a strong winner.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>Pendo would allow us to accurately track how users not only interacted with new features but also how members of an account did as well, effectively treating an account like an individual. In addition, it would go on to let us recruit users for research right within the app itself, requiring fewer email campaigns, and less red tape with other departments. Further advantages included better display of product-related data, like user flows, goal tracking, and integrating with user data held within other systems.</p>
							<figure>
								<div class="">
									<img data-src="design-ops-research-plan-pendo-flow.png" alt="a flow chart showing a drill down of page visits through an app">
								</div>
								<figcaption>This was one of the coolest features in Pendo. Funnels are very common in analytic tracking software, but this feature would let us see up to five steps in front or behind of an identified step in a flow without knowing what those steps were ahead of time. In other words, we could easily see where users came from, or what they interacted with after completing a wizard for example.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>Ultimately, the addition of this software offered incredible advantages to our team, however, we did have to deal with things like GDPR, legal policies, etc. along the way, which were good learning experiences.</p>

							<h4>Creating a Database for User Insights</h4>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>We had already set the stage for more user research, better users to pull from, and tracking what those users were doing. But what about the data from those sources? The team wanted to create a database to house user insights. Previous to this, the insights and takeaways from ad-hoc user research were kept in spreadsheets or word documents.</p>
							<p>A data-centric designer on my team wanted to try a piece of software called <a href="https://knack.com/">Knack</a> which would allow her to make forms and create databases catered to exactly what we needed.</p>
							<p>Insights would be entered and tagged tied to users, segments, and companies that also existed in other databases, meaning that the data would be cleanlier than basic free-form entry.</p>
							<p>After creating a demo and vetting the software, we agreed that it would be the ideal candidate to triage data. In a year, would any of us remember what a user had mentioned about mobile apps in their interview? No, but the database would.</p>
							<p>Additionally, we could create views for other teams, so they always had an eye into what our user base was talking about.</p>
							<figure>
								<div class="">
									<img data-src="design-ops-research-plan-knack-a.png" alt="screenshot from knack showing an internal view of user insights">
								</div>
								<figcaption>Our colleague was most excited about the fact that Knack would allow us to organize data and get insights automatically from them. As a business's needs change rapidly, finding data to back up assumptions needed to be fast and easy.</figcaption>

							<h4>Standardizing Procedures</h4>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>A senior member of the team was most interested in creating operating procedures. I also saw this as a clear cut-need, as lean research is helpful, but there is no reason why it can't be structured for the benefit of the kind users that give us their time.</p>
							<p>Scripting can take a lot longer than one thinks and requires a lot of revision and anticipation, but it's ultimately worth it to create a zero-state for all research efforts.</p>
							<p>All communications were outlined as templates, and standard procedures were documented and shared on our team intranet. While these were only starters and a basis, they were structured to give newer designers clear direction, but flexible enough to encourage them to use what worked best for their needs. Some of the types of scripts my colleague created included:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Recruiting campaign</li>
								<li>Scheduling user interviews</li>
								<li>Follow up email templates</li>
								<li>Interview scripts</li>
								<li>Research plan templates</li>
							</ul>

				<h3>Conclusions and Learning Opportunities</h3>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p>This initiative included a lot of what UX designers are taught as the "dream" of UX design: really digging into data, relying on users, creating empathy, and getting buy-in on true user-centric issues. In truth, many organizations are not ready or aware of these types of procedures. In the end, our team and I were able to kick start the foundation for stronger user research practices, and really put our fingerprint on things we cared deeply about, like behavioral data, open access to users, and insight analysis.</p>
				<p>Dealing with so many stakeholders throughout this process was a great learning experience for me. Nobody wants to stand in your way to becoming a better, more scientific UX designer, however, it may not be their <strong>priority</strong>.</p>
				<p>This, of course, does not mean that giving up is the best solution, including as many stakeholders as possible and presenting your plan in a bespoke fashion are critical strategies. If the organization is more waterfall then you have to create more upfront pitches, if it's more agile, then you have to pick quick, demonstrable wins. In the end, getting any buy-in for user research as a standard practice is a win over not having anything regular or reliable before.</p>

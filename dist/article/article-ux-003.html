            <h3>Overview</h3>
         </header>
         <section>
            <p>Tasked with prioritizing a mobile application, the UX team executed a research plan to determine the urgency and scope of users' mobile needs.</p>
            <p>Because the mobile app was identified as a business need we wanted to carefully address the various strategies that Product could take toward executing it, including our recommendation against it (at that time).</p>
            <p>I took a progressive approach to the research plan, hoping to give our recommendation, while also offering some tiered solutions to address the potential directions for Product at the same time.</p>

                  </header>
                  <li>Mobile app was a frequent request from Sales.</li>
                  <li>The topic was a divisive topic within teams.</li>
                  <li>Users had very individualistic needs for mobile features.</li>
               </ul>

                  </header>
                  <li>Determine whether users required a mobile app vs. accomplishing their tasks on a desktop compputer.</li>
                  <li>Determine the scope of their needs when leaning toward mobile or desktop.</li>
                  <li>Carefully inform other stakeholders of the true requirement of a mobile application.</li>
               </ul>

                     <h4>Good to Know</h4>
                  </header>
                  <li>Mobile application would have required additional resources from development teams.</li>

            <h3>Creating a Plan</h3>
         </header>
         <section>
            <p>I started by establishing what our team did and didn't know already, and identifying what was unclear still.</p>
            <p>Our knowns included existing knowledge of competitors' approaches to mobile solutions, and how they brought those apps to market, as well as our organization's previous experience with mobile solutions in the past.</p>

               <figcaption>Example of some of our knowns about competitors, amongst other knowns and unknowns, including previous work, current customer complaints, etc.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>From there, we established key questions to further explore our unknowns:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Would creating an app simply be a sales bullet point?</li>
               <li>Would our user base be interested in a mobile app?</li>
               <li>Were previous efforts in mobile solutions successful?</li>
               <li>What problems would a mobile app be solving?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From there, I established an execution plan that Product was made aware of, so that key product owners knew our role. I identified some key milestones, including completing various types of research and discovery.</p>

            <h3>Research Steps</h3>
         </header>
         <section>
            <p>The plan for research included the following areas of research:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Survey for existing users.</li>
               <li>Investigate the scope of existing sales requests.</li>
               <li>Request competitive intel on competitors.</li>
               <li>Screen for interest on sales sites.</li>
               <li>Conduct user research.</li>
               <li>Conduct stakeholder interviews for their take on user needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We realized that in order to streamline the process, we would also need to take a two-pronged approach by asking for MVP user needs in case Product wanted to ultimately execute on a mobile solution. Therefore, we added the following steps to our plan:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Identify and prioritize key user needs to address in an MVP product.</li>
               <li>Elaborate on user stories with Product after user research.</li>
            </ul>

                  <li>The results from surveying users via a community feedback source was divisive.</li>
                  <li>Slightly less than half of users expressed an explicit interest in a mobile app.</li>
                  <li>Key user stories were gathered from self-reported user pain points.</li>

                  <li>The majority of users were not explicitly interested in a mobile app; however, they did see potential in it for other users.</li>
                  <li>Users specifically stated that many of the tasks they looked to accomplish through our desktop app, they did not have the urge to accomplish outside of their workplace.</li>
                  <li>For users who did see high value in mobile solutions, they primarily focused on the ability to meet with clients and access their cloud data on the fly.</li>
                  <li>Users consistently pointed to two potential areas for developing mobile workflows.</li>
                  <li>More key user stories were aggregated from the interviews.</li>

                  <li>Several stakeholders felt that while a mobile app was a competitive gap, that it was mostly a vanity feature.</li>
                  <li>Only a few stakeholders were able to identify experience with a customer with mobile needs.</li>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
         </header>
         <section>
            <p>After compiling our data, we were not able to recommend that mobile solutions be prioritized, but that ongoing attention be given to whether or not user sentiment was changing over time.</p>
            <p>Our stance on the mobile app was due to the fact that, while the app did not seem like a futile feature, it did not address users' top needs. Specifically, usability and technological issues they wanted addressed in their day-to-day workflows, most of which were not centered on workflows on the go.</p>

            <h3>Translating Findings Into User Needs</h3>
         </header>
         <p>Based on our user research data we identified two areas that a MVP product could focus on, while also adding some heuristic recommendations like Settings.</p>
         <p>I identified competitive gaps in features, as well as opportunities
            to tie a mobile experience in with their desktop experience.</p>

            <h3>Conclusions and Learning Opportunities</h3>
         </header>
         <section>
            <p>Our research efforts pointed to a murky (at-best) need for mobile solutions, and thus, efforts toward mobile were reduced.</p>
            <p>Product owners and tech leadership were able to fallback on our research for strategic planning.</p>
            <p>Product teams were able to identify quick wins by alleviating some painpoints in mobile workflow without devoting unecessary calories.</p>
            <p>This plan, while not all steps were approved or acted upon, was indicative how early user research can help point strategy in the right direction.</p>

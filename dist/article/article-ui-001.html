            </header>
            <section>
                <p>This initiative involved utilizing a central library of components for designers spread over three locations while utilizing as few third-party options as possible and improving the flexibility of the design assets at the same time.</p>
                <p>Previously, the team was utilizing InVision Craft for symbols, but the system was hard to catalog and difficult to scale. There was also no versioning or ownership over the system. Upon my arrival, I took on the task of owning the design system to migrate it to a point where it was ready to become a decentralized system with distributed ownership.</p>

                            <h4>Challenges</h4>
                        </header>
                        <li>The design assets would need to be usable for both expert and novice designers alike.</li>
                        <li>The system had previously been owned by Development and was organized to fit their needs, but lacked structure for implementation in prototypes.</li>
                        <li>InVision Craft was previously used to house symbols, but pushing changes to those symbols was taxing after they were implemented into design files.</li>
                        <li>Developers were utilizing a central interface library, and major changes to the components or library could equate to costly changes for their coded components.</li>
                        <li>Third party apps were difficult to get approved for my team, and thusly, I needed a solution that was barebones but efficient.</li>
                        <li>Previous designers had relied heavily on screenshots.</li>
                        <li>There was no central design file for UI componentry.</li>
                    </ul>

                        </header>
                        <li>Create a system of responsive symbols that would mimic existing components.</li>
                        <li>Make additions to the library to allow designers to create designs completely out of existing symbols.</li>
                        <li>Utilize <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">Atomic Design</a> theories.</li>
                        <li>Document and educate other designers on implementation.</li>
                        <li>Create responsive components wherever possible.</li>
                        <li>Allow components to be updated from a central library with as little friction as possible.</li>
                    </ul>

                        </header>
                        <li>My design team did not have much immediate experience with Atomic Design principles.</li>
                        <li>Many of the Development's existing components were created by a mish-mash of a previous branding company and developers at the product's MVP stage.</li>
                        <li>The app was focused on desktop-sized usage.</li>
                        <li>Some tools I utilized include <a href="https://sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, <a href="https://plantapp.io">Plant.io</a>, and various filesharing apps.</li>

                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>I've always been a systems kind of person. Order and procedure feel comforting to me. Having an opportunity to address and contribute to a system is always an exciting opportunity, in my opinion.</p>
                    <p>When I arrived on the team, the current design stack utilized Craft to house symbols. However, upon examination, it was difficult to know how to update those symbols effectively, and people could work on symbols at the same time, or overwrite others' work. Still, Craft and Sketch combined was definitely efficient.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <div class="">
                            <img data-src="ui-design-system-craft.png" alt="">

                        <figcaption></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I needed to stay efficient, but also clean up existing symbols, and organize them more effectively. The Craft library of symbols was also dated, and in no way matched any sort of taxonomy with developers. As a primary focus, I realized that updated symbols via Craft did not allow me to push changes to other designers. Whatever solution I looked for needed to be easy enough to use that I could onboard novice Sketch designers in its usage.</p>
                    <p>I explored InVision's Design System for a bit, as well as potentially jumping ship to InVision Studio or Adobe XD. However, in the end, Sketch's native Shared Library feature made a lot of sense for the team and required the fewest changes to the current process.</p>

                <p>This project was the beginning of a much more expanded design system initiative. I started by stating my goals and documenting the things that a proper designs system should cover, including things such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Design Process</li>
                    <li>Usage Guidelines</li>
                    <li>Resources</li>
                    <li>System Logic</li>
                    <li>UI Standards and Rules</li>

                        <h4>Implementing Atomic Design Structure</h4>
                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <p>One thing that bothered me about Craft was that overriding symbols was not its primary focus. Therefore, I wanted to implement Atomic Design so that the team could think about UI components modularly rather than as finished pieces.</p>
                        <p>However, one thing I realized was that Sketch required (at least, for the team at that point), a sub-layer of shared style, text styles, backgrounds, and colors that would then inform Atoms (Atomic's smallest element). In a way, they were very similar to SASS or CSS variables. After all, a rectangle of color is not exactly a semantic HTML element yet. Therefore, I used "Protons" beneath Atoms to ease symbol overrides.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <div class="">
                                <img data-src="ui-design-system-protons.png" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Because the components were organized in part way for developers, I couldn't completely restructure the design assets for Atomic taxonomy, so I relied on strict naming conventions to help organize things for other designers. They would look for the components they needed, which shared a common naming structure, but then choose between atoms, molecules, etc. rather than choosing from atoms and molecules first.</p>

                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <p>I focused on multiple states for any given component that needed to be replicated, with the goal being that designers could easily create state for their teams with little work. The strategy would be that they just needed to select a single parent symbol and start swapping things in and out as needed, rather than having a different parent symbol for every state.</p>
                        <p>To keep atoms, molecules, and protons associated with one another, I started a practice of aligning all of its unique (not shared with other symbols) together in a hierarchy. Versions of parent symbols would then be aligned top to bottom.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <div class="">

                            <figcaption></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>After making all the sizes for smaller elements like atoms and molecules the same size, all of the symbols became overrideable for state and style, like hover and focus.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <div class="">
                                <img data-src="ui-design-system-overrides.png" alt="">

                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <p>By ensuring all symbols were A) properly-sized, and B) correctly pinned, I was able to make their instances reusable and resizable in ~95% of the scenarios. There are always components, especially organisms and layouts, that are impossible to have fully resizable in Sketch in an unlimited fashion (without the help of additional plugins), but having the majority of them ready for resizing and implementation on the fly was a great benefit.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>With almost 1,000 symbols within the system, I knew that a drill down menu wasn't going to cut it for other designers. Craft had a handy search tool, and despite the structure of the new system, the sheer number of components was not easily traversable in Sketch alone. Enter Sketch Runner, which allowed us to easily type ahead for different components and narrow to a specific Atomic element size.</p>

                        <p>I utilized Plant to create versions of the centralized component file. As the number of team members grew, so too would the changes to this system over time. Therefore, I needed to have a history of changes. This would eventually lead to my team being able to review changes and approve them in the future as well.</p>

                        <p>Eventually, the design system required newer and updated components. Whenever this was necessary I would create individual prototypes for the changes and spec them for development teams.</p>
